Android OCR application for solving math equations.
In this project i tried to create a reliable application for solving mathematical equations by performing OCR on mathematical expressions. One of the disadvantages of my system is that it requires calibration to read a specific font. The current version of the application works well on characters written in fonts similar to the one of the templates. 
Tests done using the application:
	
Difficulty	|Total Test Number	|Correctly Analyzed Equation Number |	Correctly Solved Equation Number |	Correctly Analyzed Percentage	|Correctly Solved Percentage
Simple	    20	                19	                                  19	                                95%	                           95%
Normal	    15	                14	                                  14	                                93.33%                         93.33%
Complex	    15	                13	                                  12	                                86.67%	                       80%
Total	      50	                46	                                  45	                                92%	                           90%

As you can see we have correctly analyzed 92 percent of all equations. Keep in mind font picture quality and etc. Can effect this percentage greatly. Still its a high percentage. Correctly solved percentage is 2 percent lower than analyzed cause of the LaTex MathML faults.
